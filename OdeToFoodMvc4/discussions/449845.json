    "Html": "First, this is a great tutorial! Very easy to follow and understand, even for a novice.<br />\n<br />\nThe issue I have is with the Autocomplete ActionResult used in the Home Controller. I followed the tutorial, but when I enter a string into the search area, I get a bullet list of the results being returned and this is not wrapped in a label as called for in the Home Controller. The only difference I have is with jquery version. 1.7.x is shown in the tutorial, and I have 1.8.x on my machine. to date, I have not attempted to change/downgrade versions. <br />\n<br />\nCould this be the reason that I cannot get the Autocomplete to function correctly?<br />\n<br />\nThanks for all of the hard work, and I look forward to future tutorials!<br />\n",
