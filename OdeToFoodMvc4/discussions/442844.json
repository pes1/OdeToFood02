    "Html": "Ok yes sorry. As I remember I was having the same problems, and it looks like the reason was that I have already installed SQL Express. I looks that the first time when you compile the solution, VS doesn´t recognize the presence of the SQL Server express, but after calling database migrations the first time it becomes aware of it and does not generate the DB again under App_Data. (WHY?? I don't know but I could  guess that the logic behind is that if you already have the SQL Server express installed in your machine, why to use LocalBD instead). So what I did was to change the string connection inside the web config for connecting to the SQL Server Express into previously create OdeToFoodDB and everything was working fine. <br />\n",
